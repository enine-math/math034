# Problem No. 34

## Digit Factorials

$145$ is a curious number, as $1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145$.

Find the sum of all numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

> Note: As $1! = 1$ and $2! = 2$ are not sums they are not included.

Update the function `answer()` in `solution.py` with your solution.

## Instructions

Create a new directory in your math problem repo (math) called `math034`
